# Rule-Based Customer Service Chatbot ðŸ¤–

This project is a simple, rule-based chatbot designed to handle common customer service queries. It's built entirely in Python and runs in a Google Colab notebook.

## How It Works
The chatbot uses a dictionary of keywords and predefined responses. It checks the user's input for any known keywords and provides the corresponding answer. If no keywords are found, it returns a default message.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Google Colab

## How to Run
1.  Download the `.ipynb` file.
2.  Upload it to Google Colab.
3.  Run the code cell to start the interactive chat.
